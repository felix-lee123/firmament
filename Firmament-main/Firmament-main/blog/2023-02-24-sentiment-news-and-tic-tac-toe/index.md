We used [SnowNLP](https://pypi.org/project/snownlp/) and [pysenti](https://pypi.org/project/pysenti/) to compute two sentiment scores for each HK news that we scrapped daily. Using these scores, we visualize the news in a [sentiment square](/docs/NewsViz/SentimentNews). From this visualization, we can roughly know how happy/sad daily HK news is. On the other hand, we started our game development journal. Inspired by the simple tic-tac-toe implementation by [Fellipe Utaka](https://reactjsexample.com/a-tic-tac-toe-game-made-with-react-and-tailwind-css/)using tailwind and react, we implemented similarly our own [tic-tac-toe game](/docs/Games/TicTacToe).

我哋用咗[SnowNLP](https://pypi.org/project/snownlp/)同[pysenti](https://pypi.org/project/pysenti/)去計每單香港每日新聞嘅情感分數，然後用呢兩個情感分數將新聞顯示係一個[二維情感平面](/docs/NewsViz/SentimentNews)上。通過呢個顯示方法，我哋可以大概見到香港每日新聞係開心多定係傷心多。此外，我哋亦踏上寫遊戲嘅旅程。睇到[Fellipe Utaka](https://reactjsexample.com/a-tic-tac-toe-game-made-with-react-and-tailwind-css/)簡單地用tailwind同react去寫井字過三關，我哋都寫左一個相似嘅[井字過三關](/docs/Games/TicTacToe)。
